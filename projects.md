## Drone Hunting Camera

### Problem Statement
Build an AI-driven camera system capable of determining the capabilities and target of a drone attack. This allows the user to rank a swarm by threat and handle them in order.

### My Role
Developed a camera testbed to assist in the development of an AI-driven, drone swarm targeting algorithm.

### Constraints
- Stationary System  
- RGB/Night Vision Camera  
- IR Camera  
- Gimbal Attachment  
- Zoom Camera & Range Finder  
- Six Peripheral RGB Cameras  
- NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin  
- 18V Battery, 2 Buck/Boost Converters  
- Touch Screen  
- Use only materials freely available to Rowan University students  

### Design Elements
#### Acrylic + 3D Printed Frame  
The shell is laser-cut acrylic for visibility, with PETG 3D-printed brackets for durability. TPU feet absorb shocks and adapt to uneven surfaces.

#### Stationary Camera System  
Combines an RGB/Night Vision camera and an IR camera into a compact unit, optimizing airflow to prevent overheating. Features threaded brass inserts for prototyping and easy mounting.

## Ordinary Wallet
### Inspiration
Inspired by the Ridge Wallet, this modular design allows customization, durability, and easy part replacement.

### Constraints
- All components/jigs made in-house using FFF/SLA printers and desktop CNC machines.  
- Designed for daily use with high durability.  

### Design Elements
#### External ID  
Holds essential cards for quick access. Originally SLA-printed, but after testing, UV-resistant resin was used for improved durability. Future versions will include metal edges for added strength.

#### Integrated NFC Chip  
Embedded NFC chip enables the user to store and write any necessary information (e-wallet, social media, contact page, etc.).

## 3D Printer Toolchanger
### Problem Statement
Enhancing a Creality Ender 3 V2 to include low-power laser engraving for PCB prototyping while maintaining print quality.

### Constraints
- Minimal materials/budget.  
- Toolhead must maintain consistent positioning between swaps.  
- Thermally resistant mounting system to prevent warping.  
- Safety considerations: fume removal, filtering, and protective glasses.  

### Design Elements
#### Snap-Fit Dovetails  
Dovetail-style mounting allows tool swaps without screws or fasteners. SLA-printed mounts prevent heat creep and warping.

#### Signal Re-routing  
Integrated a toggle switch to reroute the PWM signal from the print head’s cooling fan to the laser module. This allows precise laser power control without modifying core printer functionality.

## Engineer's Toolkit
### Problem Statement
Carrying a full toolbox was impractical for a student frequently moving between classes, labs, and meetings. A compact, organized toolset was needed.

### Constraints
- Small and lightweight for portability.  
- Only essential tools included to balance versatility and weight.  
- Secure storage to prevent damage/loss.  
- Discreet case design for academic settings.  

### Design Elements
#### Compact Casing  
Repurposed clipboard storage case with foam padding to secure tools while maintaining a professional appearance.

#### Tool Selection  
- Micro-screwdriver with interchangeable bits.  
- X-Acto knife for precision cutting.  
- Pliers and side cutters.  
- Vernier calipers for accurate measurements.  
- Tweezers for handling small parts.
