## Drone Targeting Camera  

### Overview  
This project involved designing an **AI-driven camera system** capable of analyzing drone swarms in real-time. The goal was to classify drones based on threat level and provide prioritization data for defensive measures.  

### My Role  
I developed the **camera testbed** and **sensor integration system**, ensuring that the device could capture and process multiple spectrums of light, including RGB, infrared, and night vision.  

### Design Constraints  
- Must be a **stationary system** with easy deployment.  
- Requires **six peripheral cameras** for full situational awareness.  
- Integrated **NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin** for AI-based drone recognition.  
- Powered by an **18V battery with buck/boost converters** for power regulation.  
- Must use materials **freely available to Rowan University students**.  

### Design Features  

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Acrylic + 3D Printed Frame**  
- The enclosure was laser-cut from acrylic for visibility, with **PETG 3D-printed brackets** for durability.  
- **TPU feet** were added for shock absorption and surface adaptability.  

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Sensor Camera System**  
- Includes an **RGB/Night Vision camera** and **IR sensor** for night operation.  
- **Zoom camera & range finder** provide accurate target acquisition.  
- **Threaded brass inserts** allow for easy mounting and prototyping.

## Ordinary Wallet  

### Overview  
Inspired by the **Ridge Wallet**, this modular design allows for **customization, durability, and easy part replacement**. Unlike traditional wallets, this one incorporates **NFC capabilities** and a flexible external ID holder.  

### My Role  
I designed and manufactured the wallet using **FFF/SLA 3D printing** and **desktop CNC machining**, ensuring that all components could be fabricated in-house.  

### Design Constraints  
- **Durable enough** for everyday use while maintaining a **lightweight profile**.  
- All components/jigs must be **made in-house**.  
- Must accommodate **integrated NFC functionality**.  

### Design Features  

**1Ô∏è‚É£ External ID Holder**  
- Provides quick access to essential cards.  
- Originally SLA-printed but later **reinforced with UV-resistant resin** for durability.  
- Future versions will include **metal edges for added strength**.  

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Integrated NFC Chip**  
- Embedded chip allows the user to store and write custom data (e.g., **e-wallet, social media, business card**).  
- Can be scanned via smartphone for instant sharing of information.

## 3D Printer Toolchanger  

### Overview  
Enhancing a **Creality Ender 3 V2** by adding a **low-power laser engraving module** for PCB prototyping while maintaining **print quality and repeatability**.  

### My Role  
Developed a **quick-swap toolhead system** that allows users to switch between a **standard 3D printing extruder** and a **laser engraver** without recalibrating the printer.  

### Design Constraints  
- Must use **minimal materials and budget**.  
- Toolhead must maintain **consistent positioning between swaps**.  
- Must be **thermally resistant** to prevent heat warping.  
- Safety considerations: **fume removal, protective glasses, and filtered exhaust**.  

### Design Features  

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Snap-Fit Dovetails**  
- **Dovetail-style mounting system** eliminates the need for screws/fasteners.  
- SLA-printed mounts ensure **tight fitment and heat resistance**.  

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Signal Re-routing for PWM Control**  
- Integrated a **toggle switch** to reroute the **PWM signal** from the print head‚Äôs cooling fan to the laser module.  
- This allows precise power control without modifying the printer's firmware.
