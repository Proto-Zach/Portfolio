<p>Showcasing my journey as an engineer and designer.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>When I started my undergraduate studies, school wasn’t my main priority. Between running a landscaping business from age 12 and working full-time weekends as a kitchen manager throughout my first years at Rowan, my focus was on making ends meet and gaining practical experience. Juggling 85-hour work weeks while also managing coursework over the summer, taught me resilience and the importance of time management. These experiences shaped my strong work ethic and ability to balance competing priorities, but they also kept me from fully dedicating myself to academics.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I took Dr. Mitja Trkov’s Intro to Soft Robotics course that I realized where my true passion lay. The class opened my eyes to the exciting, cutting-edge developments happening in engineering and ignited my desire to pursue it as a full-time focus. The lessons I learned in that class helped me see the value of mental effort, and I knew that engineering was where I needed to invest my energy. That realization led to my current involvement in Dr. Trkov’s Soft Robotics and Human-Machine Interaction labs, where I’ve been fortunate to work on the development of a hip and knee exoskeleton for gait perturbation detection and rebalancing. This research experience has sharpened my ability to focus on both the details and the big picture, a skill that has been invaluable in collaborative projects.</p>

<p>I’ve also gained entrepreneurial experience as the founder of Ordinary Engineering, a prototyping and engineering business. Running my own company has given me a unique perspective on product development—not just in terms of design but also in manufacturability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. I’ve learned to see a product as a whole, from conception to consumer, and how to turn creative ideas into tangible, reproducible solutions.</p>

<p>I’m now eager to pursue a master’s degree in mechanical engineering to further deepen my knowledge and grow as both an engineer and business owner. My goal is to focus on manufacturing and automation, with an emphasis on making engineering solutions more accessible to the ordinary person, just as I’ve always envisioned with my business.</p>

<p>The combination of my work experiences, research projects, and entrepreneurial journey has given me the tools to thrive in graduate school. I am excited about the challenge of surrounding myself with like-minded individuals who will push me to be a better engineer and a better person.</p>

<p>If I could summarize my journey in a thought, it would be this: every experience has led me to this point, and I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>
